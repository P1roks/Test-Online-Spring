# Simple app that tests your skills before INF.03 exam
It lets you select the number of questions that will be presented to you, and after you answer all of them, presents you with your score

# How to launch:
1. git clone
2. impoort the database in /src/main/resources/data.sql
3. ./mvnw spring-boot:run
4. go to localhost:8080 on the browser

# TODO:
- Make the app show details after you submit your quiz (what answer was right if you got a given question wrong)
- Structural improvements
